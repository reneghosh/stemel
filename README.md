# SteMeL

A music notation format inspired by step sequencers and [MML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language).

Its purpose is to store a musical score in format that's both human readable and usable in code.

## SteMeL by example

```
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|-|0|-|0|-|0|-|0|-|0|-|0|-|0|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
```

You'd write: `0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,`
