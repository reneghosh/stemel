**NOTE**: SteMeL is very much a work in progress at the moment as the syntax and scope are changing. I'm not

A music notation format inspired by step sequencers and [MML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language), to write music in a format that's both **human readable** and **code-exploitable**. Stemel makes it easy to write long sequences of melodies. Chords. Counterpoint.
